	abstract = {The well-being of participants at major destination events has received little empirical attention in the literature. This paper explores LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender \& other sexual minority) event participants' hedonic and eudaimonic well-being at the iconic Hangzhou Rainbow Marathon (HRM) in China. PERMA (Positive Emotions, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Achievement) psychological model of human flourishing was adopted to analyze hedonic and eudaimonic well-being. Mixed qualitative methods, in the form of semi-structured in-depth interviews and a focus group, were used to address the research aim. This data was supported by informal personal observations at the marathon site. Distinctions among participants' experiences were identified, resulting in slightly different perceptions of PERMA elements for paraders, volunteers and organizers. Through this role-based perspective, an event specific PERMA model emerged. Implications for event organizers and marketing specialists are provided.},

	abstract = {Despite the pervasiveness of pay-what-you-want pricing in the travel and hospitality industry, tourism scholars have devoted little effort to investigating the effectiveness of this pricing scheme. The current research examines the joint effect of social crowding (crowded vs. non-crowded) and self-construal (interdependent vs. independent) on tourists' pay-what-you-want payments. The results indicate that crowding lowers payment amounts among individuals high in interdependent self-construal, but such an effect is not observed among people high in independent self-construal. Furthermore, the mediation analysis shows that self-dehumanization is the psychological mechanism underlying the negative crowding effect. The research findings help tourism operators to realize when and why social crowding lowers people's pay-what-you-want payments, thus enhancing the effectiveness of pay-what-you-want pricing.},

@article{Zhou_JCR_2025,
	abstract = {Generative AI promises to help people work, entertain, and even socialize better, and it has quickly been adopted by consumers and employees across demographic categories, lifestyles, and industries. Yet, we lack an understanding of how AI use influences consumers’ relationships and judgments of others. Does AI use enhance or diminish the reputation of service providers, physicians, entrepreneurs, and other employees? Seven studies (total N = 3,571, six preregistered) uncovered a consistent pattern: consumers view workers who use AI as being both less warm and less competent. These negative impressions reduce consumers’ willingness to follow the advice of doctors who use AI and support non-profit founders who use AI. The impressions are also persistent; consumers continue to perceive AI users as less warm and competent even after reading about how AI can help them better perform their work. Our research advances theory and practice by illustrating a challenge faced by businesses and employees who use AI: even when AI improves service quality, consumers may avoid using services when the providers use AI because they have a less favorable impression of the service provider.},
