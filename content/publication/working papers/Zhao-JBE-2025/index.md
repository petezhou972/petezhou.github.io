abstract: Charitable organizations increasingly turn to artificial intelligence tools  
    to address the challenge of soliciting charitable donations. However,  
    unlike in corporate contexts, the use of AI in  
    charitable settings may signal extrinsic motives—such as cost  
    reduction or efficiency gains—rather than the genuine altruistic  
    intent donors expect, ultimately reducing donor engagement. A field  
    experiment on Facebook revealed significantly lower click-through  
    rates for AI-labeled charitable ads (Study 1, N =  
    118,927). Controlled experiments (Studies 2-3, N = 761) confirmed  
    this negative effect and showed that charitable AI usage  
    heightens perceptions of extrinsic organizational motivation while diminishing  
    perceived authenticity—sequential mediators that explain reduced charitable giving.  
    Study 4 (N = 599) demonstrated that when charitable AI  
    usage is framed around intrinsic motivations, the observed negative  
    effects are attenuated. Crucially, entity type moderates this phenomenon:  
    Corporations avoid backlash for charitable AI usage, whereas nonprofits  
    experience significantly greater negative effects (Study 5, N =  
    995). These findings introduce a novel motivational perspective to  
    AI adoption research and provide actionable guidelines for organizations  
    adopting AI technology in charitable activities.
