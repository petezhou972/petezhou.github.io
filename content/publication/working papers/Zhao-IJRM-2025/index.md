abstract: This research investigates how perceived economic mobility affects  
    consumers’ engagement in dependency-oriented charitable giving, which provides  
    immediate relief for recipients’ pressing problems rather than empowering  
    recipients with the skills and knowledge to address their  
    own challenges. Through a series of four studies, including  
    an analysis of a representative secondary dataset, the findings  
    reveal that individuals with a higher (vs. lower) perceived  
    economic mobility are less inclined to contribute to dependency-oriented  
    charitable giving, primarily due to diminished empathy towards recipients.  
    Importantly, this research also uncovers a key moderating factor—  
    framing charitable appeals as autonomy-oriented. The moderating effect offers  
    crucial insights and actionable strategies for policy-makers and  
    non-profit organizations seeking to counteract the decline in  
    dependency-oriented charitable giving associated with high perceived economic mobility.
