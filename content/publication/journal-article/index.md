abstract: Despite the pervasiveness of pay-what-you-want pricing in the travel and
  hospitality industry, tourism scholars have devoted little effort to investigating
  the effectiveness of this pricing scheme. The current research examines the joint
  effect of social crowding (crowded vs. non-crowded) and self-construal (interdependent
  vs. independent) on tourists' pay-what-you-want payments. The results indicate that
  crowding lowers payment amounts among individuals high in interdependent self-construal,
  but such an effect is not observed among people high in independent self-construal.
  Furthermore, the mediation analysis shows that self-dehumanization is the psychological
  mechanism underlying the negative crowding effect. The research findings help tourism
  operators to realize when and why social crowding lowers people's pay-what-you-want
  payments, thus enhancing the effectiveness of pay-what-you-want pricing.
