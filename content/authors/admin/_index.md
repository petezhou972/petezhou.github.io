**Hello, My name is Pete!**
I am a doctoral candidate in Marketing at the University of Arizona's Eller College of Management. My research interests converge at the intersection of three key areas:
- **Artificial Intelligence and Technology**: My research explores the dynamics of AI adoption, revealing how we perceive AI users, how we interact with AI systems, and the evaluations we form about AI-generated content.
- **Social Influence**: My research examines how societal perceptions (e.g., perceived economic mobility) and everyday social contexts (e.g., purusing goal with others), shape human behavior and decision-making processes. 
- **Consumer Well-being & Culture**: My research also investigates the role of small businesses and organizations (e.g., chorus and local support communities) in promoting consumer well-being and (re)shaping consumer culture in the marketplace through the theoretical lens of positive psychology and institution theory.

Before joining the PhD program, I earned an MPhil. in Management from Zhejiang University, China, and gained research experience as a research associate at the Behavioral Research Lab of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

**I am on the job market of 2025-2026.**
